Example of data returned when querying a subreddit thread for more children
that weren't returned with top level threadComment call due to limits.

https://www.reddit.com/api/morechildren/.json?api_type=json&sort=new&link_id=t3_68rxw2&children=dh0tf5k





api_type	       the string json
children	       a comma-delimited list of comment ID36s
id	             (optional) id of the associated MoreChildren object
link_id	          fullname of a link
sort	           one of (confidence, top, new, controversial, old, random, qa, live)






Example of processing an entire thread:
{USING MY TEST THREAD} with a limit of one and sort of old


First call with a limit of one
https://www.reddit.com/r/test/comments/5xnbad/.json?sort=old&threaded=false&limit=1

Returns oldest comment (due to sorting by old).
Returns TWO MORE chunks?

---------------------------------------------------
FIRST CHUNK
{
    "kind": "more",
    "data": {
        "count": 4,
        "name": "t1_dejdc9t",                 # seems to be arbitrarily the first child below
        "id": "dejdc9t",                      # ditto
        "parent_id": "t1_dejda4f",
        "depth": 1,
        "children": [
            "dejdc9t",
            "dejdate"
        ]
    }
}
THIS POINTS AT TWO IMMEDIATE CHILDREN OF THE COMMENT RETURNED ABOVE.
"dejdc9t" AND "dejdate"
which accounts for depth value of 1
"dejdc9t" has two children as well which might account for the count value of 4

---------------------------------------------------
SECOND CHUNK
{
    "kind": "more",
    "data": {
        "count": 38,
        "name": "t1_dejdf5s",
        "id": "dejdf5s",
        "parent_id": "t3_5xnbad",
        "depth": 0,
        "children": [
            "dejdf5s",
            "dejde9u",
            "dgykxno",
            "dejddl6",
            "dejdfgu",
            "dh12idt",
            "dejdd7m",
            "dejemg4",

            "dejddeu",
            "dejdewe",
            "dgykx1k",
            "dgyf703",
            "dgydfby",
            "dgzmtdk",
            "dejde7w",
            "dejdfb2",
            "dgzmzqu",
            "dejddty",
            "dejddqf",
            "dejdefc",
            "dejdeoy",
            "dejeekt",
            "dejdfdu",
            "dejdf88",
            "dejdf15",
            "dejdejh",
            "dejdece",
            "dejddwl",
            "dgykv38",
            "dejde3q",
            "dgydaik",
            "dejdem6",
            "dejddo6",
            "dejek8s",
            "dejderj"
        ]
    }
}
THIS POINTS AT THE 36 TOP LEVEL COMMENTS at a depth of zero
Two of these comments have one reply which accounts for depth of 38 returned

#01: Make the request sending the link_id and a comma-delimited list of up to 20 comment IDs


#02: Assuming TEST #2 works, what is the best way to later test if new comments have been added to a thread.
     Do I reverse the process and start from newest comments to oldest until I meet where the previous comments
     were saved?

#03: THIS ALLOWS DIRECT GETTING OF ITEMS BY THEIR ID
     GET [/r/subreddit]/api/inforead
     Return a listing of things specified by their fullnames.
     Only Links, Comments, and Subreddits are allowed.
     id	A comma-separated list of thing fullnames
     url	a valid URL

#04: UNDOCUMENTED (OR I HAVENT FOUND DOCUMENTATION)
     METHOD TO WATCH ALL COMMENTS TO A SUBREDDIT
     https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/
     THEN
     https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/?count=25&after=t1_dgxyqn1

#05: IF IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A BOTTLENECK SPEED WIZE IN GETTING ALL COMMENTS FOR A THREAD
     REVIEW REDDIT GOLD FEATURES AND SEE IF THAT LIFTS THE BOTTLENECK and SEE IF THAT SAME
     LIFTING OF LIMITATION WOULD APPLY TO AN API CALL USING THAT ACCOUNT???????????
     "You could buy your bot's account Reddit Gold and have access to a lot more comments at
     once. If you don't want to do this, you could add limit=500 to your requests if it's not
     already grabbing 500 at a time.""
     "If the account making the request has gold, it will be able to receive up to 1,500
     comments by using limit=1500"
     Limit without reddit gold seems to be 500

#06: Example of somone using moreChildren. Specified as:
     http://www.reddit.com/api/morechildren
     Posting:
     {
        "api_type":"json",
        "link_id":"t3_XXXXXX",
        "children":"t1_XXXXXX,t1_XXXXXX,...",
        "sort":"old"
     }
     Question: what does the posting part mean and is it the same as I've been passing values via url prams?
